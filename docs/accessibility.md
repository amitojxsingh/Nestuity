# Accessibility Features

We have designed the project to be as accessible as possible, ensuring that the interface is easy to use, navigate, and understand for all users. The following features highlight the accessibility measures implemented:

---

## Visual Accessibility

**Color Independence**  
Information is not conveyed solely through color, ensuring users with color vision deficiencies can access all content.

**High-Contrast Text**  
Text colors are chosen to ensure good readability.

**Avoid Embedded Text in Images**  
Text is never embedded in images, so content is always selectable and readable.

**Focus Indicators**  
Selected items are clearly highlighted to show where you are on the page.

---

## Content Accessibility

**Alternative Text for Images**  
All meaningful images include descriptive alt text to assist screen readers.

**Clear Hyperlinks**  
Hyperlinks provide meaningful context so users know where each link leads.

**Simplified and Structured Content**  
Text is concise, organized with headings and lists, and avoids unnecessary jargon to reduce cognitive load.

---

## Interaction Accessibility

**Keyboard Accessibility**  
All interactive elements are fully operable via keyboard, allowing users who cannot use a mouse to navigate the interface.

**Accessible Forms**  
Forms include clear labels, instructions, proper input types, and logical tab order to support screen readers and keyboard navigation.

**Error Prevention and Feedback**  
Forms provide real-time validation and clear, descriptive error messages to guide users in correcting mistakes.

**No Automatic Image Sliders or Carousels**  
Users control content flow without forced movement that can be distracting or inaccessible.

---

## Device Accessibility

**Responsive Design**  
The interface adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring accessibility on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

By following these accessibility features, our project ensures an inclusive experience for all users, aligning with best practices and accessibility standards.
